		<p>The AE86 series of the Toyota Sprinter Trueno are small, front-engine/rear-wheel-drive models within the front-engine/front-wheel-drive fifth generation Corolla (E80) range — marketed by Toyota from 1983 to 1987 in coupé and liftback configurations.</p>
		<p>Made famous by the Initial D anime and manga who's story is about 18 year old Takumi Fujiwara who is an average high school kid. His father, Bunta Fujiwara, owns a tofu shop and Takumi is the delivery boy. He uses his father's Panda 1983 Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT-APEX AE86 to do the deliveries. Takumi hated driving because he was forced to drive since he was in middle school. The deliveries train his extraordinary driving skills. His friends learn about his skills, and introduce Takumi into the world of Touge racing. Takumi eventually loves street racing, and driving altogether, and then he has only one priority: To become the best driver in the Gunma Prefecture.</P>

		<p>The Nissan Skyline GT-R (Japanese: 日産・スカイラインGT-R, Nissan Sukairain GT-R) is a sports car based on the Nissan Skyline range. The first cars named "Skyline GT-R" were produced between 1969 and 1972 under the model code KPGC10, and were successful in Japanese touring car racing events. This model was followed by a brief production run of second-generation cars, under model code KPGC110, in 1973.<br>

After a 16-year hiatus, the GT-R name was revived in 1989 as the BNR32 ("R32") Skyline GT-R. Group A specification versions of the R32 GT-R were used to win the Japanese Touring Car Championship for four years in a row. The R32 GT-R also had success in the Australian Touring Car Championship, with Jim Richards using it to win the championship in 1991 and Mark Skaife doing the same in 1992, until a regulation change excluded the GT-R in 1993. The technology and performance of the R32 GT-R prompted the Australian motoring publication Wheels to nickname the GT-R "Godzilla" in its July 1989 edition.[1][2] Wheels then carried the name through all the generations of Skyline GT-Rs, most notably the R34 GT-R, which they nicknamed "Godzilla Returns", and described as "The best handling car we have ever driven" and in their tests covered a quarter of a mile (402 metres) in 12.2 seconds from a standing start time and accelerated from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.0 seconds.
